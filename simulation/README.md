# AH Simulation Submodule

Most of my work in my Masters was involved with simulation of physics.  In this submodule, I've made wrappers for COMSOL - a multiphysics simulation platform, MCNP - the radiation transport simulation platform of choice for low fluxes such as is seen in detection work, and SPICE - an electrical simulation software.
